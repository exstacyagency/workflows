Customer Interview - Jan 15, 2024

Q: Why did you buy these headphones?
A: I travel a lot for work and needed better noise cancellation. My old ones weren't cutting it on planes.

Q: What almost stopped you from buying?
A: The price. $400 is a lot. But reviews convinced me it was worth it.

Q: What would you change?
A: The case is too bulky. Hard to fit in my carry-on.
